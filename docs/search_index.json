It combines ideas from statistics, computer science, and particular domains in the physical and social sciences in order to make predictions and optimal decisions. This SMU summer intensive course is designed with a practical approach. The students will be guided to learn the basics and move on to more advanced topics in 2 weeks. The final 1 week will be dedicated to practicing and presenting data science skills and competency through capstone projects. The Data Science Capstone is a team-based, project-based session, providing an opportunity to apply data science skills and knowledge obtained from the first 2 weeks of the foundation session. Teams of two or three students, under the direction of the course instructor and teaching assistants, will be working on a data project. The primary objective is to educate the students in solving real world data science problems in professional settings by leveraging their own computational, statistical, and domain skills. The capstone will end with a final presentation. "],["intro.html", "Chapter 2 Introduction", " Chapter 2 Introduction You can label chapter and section titles using {#label} after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter 2. If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter 4. Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 2.1: Here is a nice figure! Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 2.1. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 2.1. knitr::kable( head(iris, 20), caption = &#39;Here is a nice table!&#39;, booktabs = TRUE ) Table 2.1: Here is a nice table!
